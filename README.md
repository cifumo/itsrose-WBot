# itsrose-WBot
Itsrose is ready to TEST, but not ready to use in production. Just say it `beta` haha.

## Features
I assume you know what this bot is for, so I won't explain it here.
The main feautures are:
- [x] Device information
  - if you say ping, or "show me the cpu model", it will show it. Anything that related to device information, it will show you the device information.
- [x] Chat
  - if you say "hi", it will say "hi" back. Yeah its openai, so it will learn from you.
- [ ] Others
  - I will add more features soon.
