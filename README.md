# itsrose-WBot
Danil Elistzakov's

## Features
I assume you know what this bot is for, so I won't explain it here.
The main feautures are:
- [x] Device information
  - if you say ping, or "show me the cpu model", it will show it. Anything that related to device information, it will show you the device information.
- [x] Chat
  - if you say "hi", it will say "hi" back. haha.
- [x] Stable diffusion
  - if you say "I wanna see mountain", it will send you the mountain image.
- [x] Convert image
  - if you say "convert image using anime style", it will convert the image into anime. You'll need to send the image first, with caption "convert image using anime style".
- [ ] Others
  - I will add more features soon.

## Advantages
- [x] OpenAI
  - I use openai to make this bot more intelligent.
  - Sometimes the openai API will give you rate limit error, so you need to wait for a few minutes. Otherwise, pay for the API.
- [ ] MongoDB
  - Iwant to use mongodb to store the data, but idk.
